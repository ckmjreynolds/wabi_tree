# Use Test-Driven Development (TDD)
We use TDD in this project. You should expect to run tests without prompting. You will usually be brought in after a failing test has been written.

# Iterate to fix lint, build, and test failures.
You should iterate to fix any lint or build errors or test failures without prompting.

# Follow DRY
Where possible, follow Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), refactoring as needed.

# When running "git diff" do not use a pager.
git --no-pager diff
