# Code of Conduct (Technical Focus)

This project is built around engineering discussion. We evaluate ideas and changes
on technical merit: correctness, tests, clarity, performance, API design, and
documentation.

## Principles

- Be professional and respectful.
- Critique code and ideas, not people.
- Keep discussions focused on the project and the work at hand.
- Assume good intent; ask questions before escalating.

## Expected behavior

- Provide evidence: benchmarks, tests, references, minimal repros.
- Prefer concrete proposals over rhetoric.
- Keep review feedback actionable and specific.
- Disagree without hostility.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Personal attacks, insults, or degrading language.
- Harassment, intimidation, or unwanted contact.
- Disruptive behavior that derails technical threads (e.g., persistent off-topic
  arguments after being asked to stop).
- Publishing private information without permission.

## Maintainer moderation

Maintainers may edit, hide, lock, or remove content and may restrict
participation to keep the project productive and welcoming.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it privately:

- Contact: chris@reynolds.guru

Reports will be handled discreetly.
